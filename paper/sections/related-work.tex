\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

In this section, we present an extended version of the related work description made in the proposal for this research~\cite{Sicard-Ramirez2016}.



% On the one hand, we have the
% automatic theorem provers (henceforth \ATP) and their specification
% logic. These tools are usually classified in at least one of the
% following categories.
% A \SAT solver (e.g., \name{zChaff}~\cite{Moskewicz2001} and
% \name{MiniSat}~\cite{Een2004}) to prove unsatisfiability of \CNF
% formulas, a \abbre{QBF} solver (e.g.,
% \name{GhostQ}~\cite{Klieber2014} and
% \name{DepQBF}~\cite{Lonsing2017}) to prove satisfiability and
% invalidity of quantified Boolean formulas, a \SMT solver
% (e.g \name{CVC4}~\cite{Barrett2011}, \name{veriT}~\cite{bouton2009},
% and \name{Z3}~\cite{DeMoura2008}) to prove unsatisfiability of
% formulas from first-order logic with theories, and a prover for
% validity of formulas from first-order logic with equality
% (e.g., \name{E}~\cite{Schulz:AICOM-2002},
% \name{leanCoP}~\cite{Otten2008},
% \Metis~\cite{hurd2003first},
% \name{SPASS}~\cite{Weidenbach2009} and
% \name{Vampire}~\cite{Riazanov1999}), high-order logic (e.g.,
% \name{Leo-II}~\cite{Benzmuller2008} and
% \name{Satallax}~\cite{Brown2012}) or intuitionistic logic (e.g.,
% \name{ileanCoP}~\cite{Otten2008},
% \name{JProver}~\cite{Schmitt2001}, and
% \name{Gandalf}~\cite{Tammet1997}), among others. On the other hand,
% we have the proof checkers, interactive theorem provers (henceforth
% \ITP) or proof assistants (e.g., \Agda~\cite{agdateam},
% \name{Coq}~\cite{coqteam},
% \name{Isabelle}~\cite{paulson1994isabelle}, and
% \name{HOL4}~\cite{norrish2007hol}).


\name{Isabelle/HOL} incorporated \Metis as a macro-step
reconstruction tool for explaining proof steps (usually \CNF goals)
replied from other \ATPs like \name{CVC4}, \name{Vampire}, or
\name{Z3} (more details in Ref.~\cite{paulson2007source}).
\citeauthor{Farber2015} in \cite{Farber2015} present tactic based on \Metis for
\name{HOL Light} capable to challenge others tactics like \emph{MESON}
or the \emph{leanCoP} tactic~\cite{Farber2016}.

\name{Sledgehammer} is a tool for \name{Isabelle} proof assistant
\cite{paulson1994isabelle} that provides a full integration of
automatic theorem provers including \ATPs (see, for example,
\cite{meng2006automation}, \cite{blanchette2013extending} and
\cite{Fleury2014}) and \SMT solvers (see, for instance,
\cite{hurlin07practical}, \cite{bohme2010},
\cite{blanchette2013extending}, and \cite{Fleury2014}) with
\name{Isabelle/HOL} \cite{nipkow2002isabelle}, the specialization of
\name{Isabelle} for higher-order logic.
\citeauthor{Een2004}~\cite{Een2004} integrates \name{Leo-II} and
\name{Satallax}, two theorem provers for high-order logic with
\name{Isabelle/HOL} proposing a modular proof-reconstruction work
flow.

\name{SMTCoq}~\cite{armand2011,Ekici2017} is a tool for the
\name{Coq} proof assistant \cite{coqteam} which provides a certified
checker for proof witness coming from the \SMT solver
\name{veriT}~\cite{bouton2009} and adds a new tactic named verit,
that calls \name{veriT} on any \name{Coq} goal.
In \cite{Bezem2002},
given a fixed but arbitrary first-order signature, the authors
transform a proof produced by the first-order automatic theorem
prover \name{Bliksem} \cite{deNivelle2003} in a \name{Coq} proof
term.

Hurd~\cite{Hurd1999} integrates the first-order resolution prover
\name{Gandalf} with \name{HOL}~\cite{norrish2007hol}, a high-order
theorem prover, following an \abbre{LCF} model implementing the
tactic \verb!GANDALF_TAC!. For \name{HOL Light}, a version of
\name{HOL} but with a simpler logic core, the \SMT solver \name{CVC4}
was integrated, and \citeauthor{kaliszyk2013}~\cite{kaliszyk2013}
reconstruct proofs from different ATPs with their \name{PRocH} tool,
replaying the detailed inference steps from the ATPs with internal
inference methods implemented in \name{HOL Light}.

% HOL(y)Hammer [KU15] is an automated deduction framework for HOL4 and
% HOL Light.

% Given a conjecture, it attempts to find suitable premises, then
% calls external ATPs such as E[Sch13], Vampire [KV13], or Z3 [dMB08],
% and attempts to reconstruct the proof using the premises used by the
% ATP. To reconstruct proofs, it uses tactics such as MESON,
% simplification, and a few other decision procedures, however, these
% are sometimes not p owerful enough to reconstruct proofs found by
% the external ATPs.

\name{Waldmeister} is an automatic theorem prover for unit
equational logic \cite{hillenbrand1997}.
\citeauthor{foster2011integrating}~\cite{foster2011integrating}
integrate \name{Waldmeister} into \Agda
\cite{agdateam}. This integration requires a proof-reconstruction
step, but authors' approach is restricted to pure equation logic
--also called identity theory~\cite{humberstone2011}-- that is,
first-order logic with equality but no other predicate symbols and
no functions symbols~\cite{appel1959}.

Kanso and Setzer~\cite{kanso2016light} integrate the propositional
fragment of \name{EProver} in \Agda. In this work, the authors
translate automatically propositional logic problems written in \Agda
to \TPTP problems. By calling an external wrapper of the ATP, this
tool gets a \TSTP derivation. The tool parses the \name{EProver}
derivation and outputs \Agda code.
We are able to say their proof-reconstruction is almost
similar as the approach presented in Section~\ref{ssec:workflow}.
Nevertheless, Kanso and Setzer aim to justify some of the inference
rules by using propositional semantics instead of only syntactic
treatment as shown above.
