\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Besides the logic and its complexity, the proof reconstruction task is
far from trivial. In this document, we attempt to reconstruct proofs
of propositional logic without equality deliverd by \Metis successfully.

From our experience building a proof reconstruction tool, depending on
the systems involved in thetranslation, some difficulties can arise.
We listed some of them in section \ref{sec:metis-language-and-proofs}
and in the section \ref{sec:proof-reconstruction}.

For instance, just showing equality between Normal Forms for the
same formula in the output of the \canonicalize inference and a
common implementation for this kind of conversion; we observed that
\Metis performs reordering for each inner expression mainly in the
presence of negative literals. Another aspect to take into account
is the \Metis' treatment for conjunctions and disjunction;
these connectives were treated as right associative and binary
operators in the \TSTP format but that assumptons is not a standard.
We had to update the \TSTP parser module introduced in
\cite{Gomez-Londono2015} to include features like these.

However, one of our biggest obstacles
\improvement{Remove the use of the \emph{biggest obstacules}.}
was dealing with
the Equality between formulas since, in our approach, we only work
with the syntactic treatment of the logic without considering the
semantics.
One of the main reasons for such a restriction relay on our plans to
support further first-order logic, where a semantic treatment is not
viable.\unsure{Please confirm this.}

Nevertheless, the proof reconstruction is certainly possible, and
the verification of solutions of \CPL problems can be carried out
successful in \Agda. Our tool is able to translate \Metis
derivations in \TSTP format to deliver \Agda code of the proof,
\change{Better uses \emph{proof-terms}?}
and this proof can be type-checked by \Agda.

The source code of our tool can be extended to support
other \ATPs for \CPL like \name{E}. This work can be carried out
may following the description in Kanso' Ph.D. Thesis~\cite{Kanso2012}
for the inference rules of \name{E} or \name{Z3}.

Trying to justify a proof-object of a theorem prover has a
significant impact, may increase the trustworthiness of the prover
proving its correctness, or contrary, revealing important issues to
improve the system. In both cases, there is a benefit for both
sides, the user of this technology, and their developers.

For instance, while writing this document, we found a soundness bug,
a bug in the printing out of the \TSTP derivations, and a bug in the
parsing for \TPTP problem in \Metis. Fortunately, all these bugs
were fixed quickly by Hurd\footnote{Issues No. 4, No. 2, and the
commit \name{8a3f11e} from the \Metis' official repository
\url{https://github.com/gilith/metis}}, and a new version of \Metis
was released (version 2.3, release 20170810).
