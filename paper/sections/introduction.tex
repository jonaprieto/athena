\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% Proof-reconstruction is a non-trivial task since it depends on the
% integration between two complex systems.
% We describe one proof-reconstruction approach between an automatic theorem
% prover (henceforth \ATP) and an interactive theorem prover (henceforth
% \ITP).

% The \ITP tools provide us the
% logic framework to check and validate the reply of the \ATPs since
% they allow us to define the formal language for the problems \ie,
% operators, logic variables, axioms, and theorems.

% A proof-reconstruction tool provides such an integration, translating
% the reply generated by the prover into the formalism of the proof
% assistant.

% % Since the formalism of the source (the evidence
% % generated by the \ATP) is not necessarily the same logic in the
% % target, the reconstruction turns out to be a ``reverse engineering''
% % task.

% Then, reconstructing a proof involves an in-depth
% understanding of the algorithms in the \ATP and the logic specification
% in the \ITP. To begin with the proof-reconstruction, it is
% necessary to have a proof from the \ATP in a consistent
% format, that is, a full script describing step-by-step
% with exhaustive details and without ambiguities, the derivation to
% get the actual proof.

% For problems in classical propositional logic (henceforth \CPL),
% from a list of at least forty\footnote{\ATPs available from the web
% service \name{SystemOnTPTP} of the TPTP World.} \ATPs, just a few
% provers were able to deliver proofs (e.g.,
% \name{CVC4}~\cite{Barrett2011}, \name{SPASS}, and
% \name{Waldmeister}~\cite{hillenbrand1997}) and fewer replied with
% a proof
% in a file format like \TSTP~\cite{Sutcliffe-Schulz-Claessen-VanGelder-2006}
% (e.g., \name{E}, \Metis, \name{Vampire}, and \name{Z3}),
% \len{LFSC}~\cite{Stump2008}, or the \len{SMT-LIB}~\cite{Bohme2011} format.

% Many approaches have been proposed and some tools have been
% implemented for proof-reconstruction in the last decades. These
% programs are relevant not only because it helps to spread their
% usage but they also increase the confidence of their users about
% their algorithms and their correctness (see, for example, bugs in
% \ATPs~\cite{Keller2013,Bohme2011,Fleury2014} and
% \cite{Kanso2012}).
% We mention some of these tools in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}.

% In this paper, we ported a subset of the \Metis' inference rules to
% \Agda, the propositional fragmented. The formalization of
% these rules allowed us to justify step-by-step \Metis' \TSTP derivations by
% translating automatically to \Agda by a proof-reconstruction tool built for
% this research named \Athena.
% This paper has been organized in the following way.
% In Section~\ref{ssec:CPL}, we introduce some
% notation and syntax of propositional logic.
% In Section~\ref{sec:metis-language-and-proofs}, we introduce the
% \Metis prover and its deduction system.
% In Section~\ref{sec:proof-reconstruction}, we present our
% approach to reconstruct proofs deliver by \Metis in type theory.
% Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} summarizes the main findings and includes a
% discussion of future work.
% Some related works to this paper are presented in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}.
% Finally, in appendix \textsc{A}, we provide a small example of the
% proof-reconstruction workflow.
