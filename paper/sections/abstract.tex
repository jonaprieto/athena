\begin{abstract}
We describe a syntactical proof-reconstruction
approach to verify proofs generated by \Metis prover to problems in
classical propositional logic.
To verify these \Metis proofs, we developed a tool able to translate
such derivations to \Agda proof-terms.
We formulate in type theory each inference rule found
in \Metis derivations. This allowed us to type-check \Metis proofs
step-by-step. We leave it for future work,
the opportunity to extend this work to other provers, proof assistants, and other formalisms.
