\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we describe a syntactical proof-reconstruction
approach to verify solutions generated by \Metis prover to problems in
classical propositional logic without equality.
To verify these \Metis derivations, we built a tool able to translate
such derivations to \Agda proof-terms.
We formulate in type theory each inference rule found
in \Metis derivations for the logic domain mentioned above.
This allowed us to type-check \Metis proof-objects step-by-step
with an opportunity to extend to other provers and formalisms.
