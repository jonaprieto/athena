\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we describe our approach to reconstruct and verify in
the proof assistant for type theory \Agda, solutions obtained by
the  automatic theorem prover \Metis to problems in classical
propositional logic. The translation method consists of justifying
step-by-step each deduction found in the prover's solution. To carry
out this plan, we emulate the inference rules of the prover,
providing a version of them in the proof assistant. Finally, we
parse the output of the prover, build and analyze the respective
tree associated with the proof, for ending up with an \Agda code of
the proof for type-checking.
