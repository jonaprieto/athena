\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we describe a syntactical proof-reconstruction
approach to verify solutions generated by \Metis prover to problems in classical propositional logic without equality.
To verify these \Metis derivations, we translate them automatically
to \Agda proof-terms.
Using the proof-assistant, we were able to type-check the
formalization approach presented in this work. A formulation about
the inference rules used by \Metis.
This allowed us to type-check proof-objects step-by-step.
