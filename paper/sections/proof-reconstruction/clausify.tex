\subsubsection{Clausification.}
\label{sssec:clausification}

The \clausify rule transforms a
propositional formula into its clausal normal form, a conjunction
of clauses. A \emph{clause} is the disjunction of zero or more
literals.
It is important to notice that this kind of conversion between one formula
to its clausal normal form is not unique, and \Metis has a customized
approach to perform that transformation. That is the reason we perform some
reordering for the \CNF of the source formula to fulfill this issue.

\begin{myexample}
In the following \Metis \TSTP derivation, we see how
\clausify expands the\texttt{norm0} formula to get \texttt{norm1} formula
by using distributive laws included in the conjunctive normal form conversion.

\begin{verbatim}
fof(a1, axiom, p ⇒ (q ∧ r)).
...
fof(norm0, ¬ p ∨ (q ∧ r), inf(canonicalize, [a1])).
fof(norm1, (¬ p ∨ q) ∧ (¬ p ∨ r), inf(clausify, [norm0])).
...
\end{verbatim}

\end{myexample}

\begin{mainth}
\label{thm:clausify}
  If $Γ ⊢ φ$ and $ψ : \Prop$ then $Γ ⊢ \fclausify~φ~ψ$, where,

  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
  &\hspace{.495mm}\fclausify : \Prop → \Prop → \Prop\\
  &\begin{array}{llll}
  \fclausify~φ~ψ &=
         \begin{cases}
        ψ, &\text{ if }φ≡ψ\\
        \freorder_{∧∨}~(\fcnf~φ~ψ), &\text{ otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
  \end{array}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation*}
\end{mainth}

\begin{proof}
If $φ ≡ ψ$, $Γ ⊢ \fclausify~φ~ψ$ normalizes to $Γ ⊢ ψ$. The conclusion follows by applying the $\fsubst$ lemma. Otherwise, we use Lemma~\ref{lem:reorder-and-or} and Lemma~\ref{lem:cnf}.
\end{proof}

\begin{myremark}
The \clausify rule is often preceded by the \canonicalize rule.
Both rules perform \emph{Clausification} that introduces
into the problem axioms and definitions in the domain of the solution.
The clausification algorithms is mainly described on paper by
\citeauthor{Sutcliffe1996}~\cite{Sutcliffe1996}.
