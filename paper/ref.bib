	Abstract = {Waldmeister is a high-performance theorem prover for unit equational first-order logic. In the making of Waldmeister, we have applied an engineering approach, identifying the critical points with respect to efficiency in time and space. Our logical three-level system model consists of the basic operations on the lowest level, where we put great stress on efficient data structures and algorithms. For the middle level, where the inference steps are aggregated into an inference machine, flexible adjustment has proven essential during experimental evaluation. The top level holds control strategy and reduction ordering. Although at this level only standard strategies are employed, really large proof tasks have been managed in reasonable time.},

It requires significant knowledge of the source and target systems. One cannot simply re-target to another logic. We present a modular proof reconstruction system with separate components, specifying their behaviour and describing how they interact. This system is demonstrated and evaluated through an implementation to reconstruct proofs generated by Leo-II and Satallax in Isabelle HOL, and is shown to work better than the current method of rediscovering proofs using a select set of provers.},

	Abstract = {PRocH is a proof reconstruction tool that imports in HOL Light proofs produced by ATPs on the recently developed translation of HOL Light and Flyspeck problems to ATP formats. PRocH combines several reconstruction methods in parallel, but the core improvement over previous methods is obtained by re-playing in the HOL logic the detailed inference steps recorded in the ATP (TPTP) proofs, using several internal HOL Light inference methods. These methods range from fast variable matching and more involved rewriting, to full first-order theorem proving using the MESON tactic. The system is described and its performance is evaluated here on a large set of Flyspeck problems.},

We extended Sledgehammer to invoke satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers as well, exploiting its relevance filter and parallel architecture. The ATPs and SMT solvers nicely complement each other, and Isabelle users are now pleasantly surprised by SMT proofs for problems beyond the ATPs' reach.},

This requires these provers to return not only a yes/no answer, but also a proof witness that can be independently rechecked. We present such a checker, written and fully certified in Coq. It is conceived in a modular way, in order to tame the proofs' complexity and to be extendable. It can currently check witnesses from the SAT solver ZChaff and from the SMT solver veriT. Experiments highlight the efficiency of this checker. On top of it, new reflexive Coq tactics have been built that can decide a subset of Coq's logic by calling external provers and carefully checking their answers.},
