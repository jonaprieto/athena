\begin{abstract}
  We describe a syntactical proof-reconstruction approach to verify
  derivations generated by the automatic theorem prover \Metis for
  classical propositional logic theorems. To verify these derivations,
  we use \Agda, a proof assistant for dependent type theory. We
  formalise in \Agda each inference rule of \Metis reasoning, that is,
  we transform \Metis derivations into \Agda proof-terms. In a future
  full-fledged integration of \Agda with off-the-shelf automatic
  theorem provers, proof-reconstruction shall be a necessary
  component.
