% On the one hand, we have the
% automatic theorem provers (henceforth \ATP) and their specification
% logic. These tools are usually classified in at least one of the
% following categories.
% A \SAT solver (e.g., \name{zChaff}~\cite{Moskewicz2001} and
% \name{MiniSat}~\cite{Een2004}) to prove unsatisfiability of \CNF
% formulas, a \abbre{QBF} solver (e.g.,
% \name{GhostQ}~\cite{Klieber2014} and
% \name{DepQBF}~\cite{Lonsing2017}) to prove satisfiability and
% invalidity of quantified Boolean formulas, a \SMT solver
% (e.g \name{CVC4}~\cite{Barrett2011}, \name{veriT}~\cite{bouton2009},
% and \name{Z3}~\cite{deMoura2008}) to prove unsatisfiability of
% formulas from first-order logic with theories, and a prover for
% validity of formulas from first-order logic with equality
% (e.g., \name{E}~\cite{Schulz:AICOM-2002},
% \name{leanCoP}~\cite{Otten2008},
% \Metis~\cite{hurd2003first},
% \name{SPASS}~\cite{Weidenbach2009} and
% \name{Vampire}~\cite{Riazanov1999}), high-order logic (e.g.,
% \name{Leo-II}~\cite{Benzmuller2008} and
% \name{Satallax}~\cite{Brown2012}) or intuitionistic logic (e.g.,
% \name{ileanCoP}~\cite{Otten2008},
% \name{JProver}~\cite{Schmitt2001}, and
% \name{Gandalf}~\cite{Tammet1997}), among others. On the other hand,
% we have the proof checkers, interactive theorem provers (henceforth
% \ITP) or proof-assistants (e.g., \Agda~\cite{agdateam},
% \name{Coq}~\cite{coqteam},
% \name{Isabelle}~\cite{paulson1994isabelle}, and
% \name{HOL4}~\cite{norrish2017hol}).

% HOL(y)Hammer [KU15] is an automated deduction framework for HOL4 and
% HOL Light.

% Given a conjecture, it attempts to find suitable premises, then
% calls external ATPs such as E[Sch13], Vampire [KV13], or Z3 [dMB08],
% and attempts to reconstruct the proof using the premises used by the
% ATP. To reconstruct proofs, it uses tactics such as MESON,
% simplification, and a few other decision procedures, however, these
% are sometimes not p owerful enough to reconstruct proofs found by
% the external ATPs.
