  We describe a syntactical proof-reconstruction approach to verifying
  derivations generated by the automatic theorem prover \Metis for
  classical, propositional logic. To verify the derivations, we use
  \Agda, a proof assistant for dependent type theory. We formalise in
  \Agda each inference rule of \Metis reasoning, that is, we transform
  \Metis derivations into \Agda proof-terms. In a future full-fledged
  integration of \Agda with off-the-shelf automatic theorem provers,
  proof-reconstruction shall be a necessary component.
